# Pixel Project
## In the following file you can create pixelated images by colors or by game cubes, for any image you choose.
The file has can actually perform 4 operations:
1. View the original image
2. Display the pixelated image
3. Save a csv file of the pixelated image by numbers.
4. Draw and save as an esp file the pixelated image when it is drawn by game cubes.
Behavior:
First you have to upload the image you want to pixel to the files folder. Then, copy the name of the file and put it in the appropriate place in the code. Run the code, and now you will have to answer several questions:
--------
1. How many shades would you like for the picture? It should be noted that to get the option to draw the pixelated image as game cubes you must choose a number less than or equal to 7.
2. How would you like to choose the image size? According to the total number of pixels or to manually define a number of rows and columns?
3. How many pixels, or how many rows and columns would you like?
4. Would you like to see the original image?
5. Would you like to see the pixelated image?
6. Would you like to save the new image as a csv file?
7. Would you like to see and save the pixelated image as it is drawn by game cubes?
