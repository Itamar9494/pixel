# Pixel Project
## Introduction

The program offers the following operations:

1. View the original image.

2. Display the pixelated image.

3. Save a CSV file of the pixelated image with numbers.

4. Draw and save the pixelated image as an ESP file using game cubes.

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Upload the image you want to pixelate to the files folder.

2. Copy the name of the file and paste it in the appropriate place in the code.

3. Run the code and answer the following questions:

  a. How many shades would you like for the picture? Note that to draw the pixelated image as game cubes, choose a number less than or equal to 7.

  b. How would you like to choose the image size? Based on the total number of pixels or by manually defining the number of rows and columns?

  c. How many pixels or how many rows and columns would you like?

  d. Would you like to see the original image?

  e. Would you like to see the pixelated image?

  f. Would you like to save the new image as a CSV file?

  g. Would you like to see and save the pixelated image as it is drawn by game cubes?
